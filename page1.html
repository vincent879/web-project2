  <h3>Juicy Hamburger Ingredients:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>800g - 1kg / 1.6 - 2 lb ground beef (mince), 20%+ fat</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    <li>3 onions, peeled and sliced into rings</li>
    <li>2 tbsp oil</li>
    <li>4 - 8 slices cheese of choice (optional)</li>
  </ul>
<p>Hamburger</p>
    <ul>
      <li>4 soft hamburger buns, lightly toasted</li>
      <li>Lettuce, tomato slices</li>
      <li>Ketchup, mustard, relish, sliced pickles</li>
    </ul>
<p>On The Side</p>
    <ul>
      <li>French fries</li>
      <li>Baked potato wedges</li>
    </ul>
<p>Instructions</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Separate beef into 4 equal portions. Use hands to lightly form into patties the size of your buns (mine are about 10 cm / 4") - don't press hard, light fingers = soft juicy patties</li>
      
      <li>Season generously with salt and pepper on both sides. Make a dent on one side (stop burger from become dome shape and shrinking when cooking).</li>
      <li>Heat 1 tbsp oil in a heavy based skillet or BBQ over high heat. Add onion and cook until wilted and caramelised. Season with salt and pepper, then remove.</li>
      <li>Heat 1 tbsp oil until smoking. Add patties and cook for 2 minutes until deep golden with a great crust. Do not press! Flip carefully, cook for 1 minute then top with cheese (if using). Cover with lid and cook for further 1 minute until cheese is melted.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, toast the cut side of the buns lightly.</li>
      <li>To serve: Spread base of buns with sauce / condiment of choice. Top with lettuce then tomato, then hamburger patty. Pile over onions, sliced pickles, then more sauce/condiments. Top with lid of bun. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
