  <p style="color:purple">Air Fryer French Fries Ingredients:</p>
  <ul <p style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">
    <li>3 large russet potatoes – we love russets for their rich, buttery taste, and how the starch works to puff and crisp perfectly in the air fryer. Russet potatoes have the classic, rich, potatoey flavor everyone loves. You can peel the potatoes or leave the peel on – but be sure to wash it well.</li>

    <li>2-3 tablespoons olive oil – use a good quality olive oil that you love the flavor of. You can change up the flavor of your fries by using flavored oils like garlic oil, chile oil, etc.</li>

    <li>Sea salt and pepper, to taste – I like to finish fries with either maldon salt or powdered salt for the light, salty flavor that distributes evenly.</li>

  <ul>
    <li>Prep - Using a mandoline, slice the potatoes into fries. don’t worry too much about the size of fry you can make some bigger, and some are smaller. That’s fine!</li>
    <li>Soak - Next, place your spuds in a nice cool water bath. Completely submerge the fries in water. Let fries sit one hour. This helps to remove excess starch and will help the fries crisp up more in the oven.</li>

    <li>Season - Toss with a couple tablespoons of olive oil, salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Air fry - Add fries to bottom of air fryer basket, making sure they are all on the same level (don’t stack them on top of each other.) Cook 13 minutes, until crispy and golden brown. Place on a baking sheet lined with paper towels and a cooling rack over it. Place in warm oven (set to the minimum temperature, not over 250 degrees) and let rest while other batches of fries are cooking.</li>
    <li>Enjoy! - Serve hot with sauce!</li>
